The delineation and mapping of parliamentary and assembly constituencies are fundamental to the democratic process. Accurate and accessible maps are essential for voters, political candidates, and electoral officials. Traditionally, these maps have been created and maintained using paper-based systems or basic digital tools, which often lack the interactivity and up-to-date information required in modern contexts. The advent of Web Geographic Information Systems (Web GIS) offers a powerful solution to these limitations by providing dynamic, interactive, and easily updatable maps accessible from any device with an internet connection. In this project, I have Utilized Geoserver and OpenLayers to create an interactive Web-GIS application to visualize Indiaâ€™s Parliamentary and Assembly Constituencies using interactive map-based data which retrieved information based on selected features using CQL filters.
